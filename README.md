# Simplify3D Printer Profiles

These are the Simplify3D printer profiles that I use for various materials. They are designed so that I can easily select the printer quality and additions (supports, skirts, etc), with filament-specific settings easily changed.

## Tuning

Below is a list of profiles (with more to come), and the features installed on the printer using that profile; along with recommended settings for you to look at or tune before trying to use these profiles.

**NOTE: Failure to review these profiles before using may result in the nozzle of your printer crashing into the bed (e.g. if you're not using the EZABL on profiles with that enabled.**
